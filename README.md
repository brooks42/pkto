- Evolution
    Evolve to X {cost}: Pay X. Create a token creature, X, and put this card under it. The creature on top has all abilities of creatures below it, except evolve abilities.

Evolve works a lot like the Mutate mechanic from Ikoria, except you make a token of the appropriate type instead of mutating from your hand.
