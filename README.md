## New Mechanics and FAQ

### Pokémon

Pokémon is a replacement for the Creature supertype. Pokémon act like Creatures in all respects.

### Evolution

```
Evolve to X: Create a token Pokémon, X, and put this card under it. The creature on top has all abilities of cards below it, except evolve abilities.

Evolve with Y to X: If you control Y, you Evolve as normal except that you also put Y under the created token Pokémon. If Y isn't a Pokémon, sacrifice it instead.

Evolve from X: If you control X, put this card on top of it as though it evolved into this card.
```

Evolve works a lot like the Mutate mechanic from Ikoria, except you make a token of the appropriate type instead of mutating from your hand.
